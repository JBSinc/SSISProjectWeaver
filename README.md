Metadata-driven control of execution and dependencies of any number of projects/packages through a single entry-point stored procedure, within a "batch", without the need for "master" control flow type packages. Change control flow/dependencies on the fly without the need for any code deployment. Make package execution dependent on the result of any SQL statement. Execute any SQL statement (e.g. basic stored proc, xp_cmdshell, start a SQL Agent job, etc.) during key points within a batch.
