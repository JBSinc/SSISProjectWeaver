#SSIS Project Weaver

Welcome to the SSIS Project Weaver repository. Here you will find everything you need to either 1) extend the flexible SSIS Project Weaver T-SQL-based SSIS execution framework or 2) deploy the framework and begin using it to execute your SQL Server Integration Services 2012, 2014, and/or 2016 projects. 

##Overview
The framework consists of a completely T-SQL based approach to defining and executing SSIS packages including the order of execution and dependencies (on other packages and custom SQL-based triggers). It also enables the execution of any valid T-SQL command(s) at user-defined points in time throughout a "batches" execution. In addition, SSIS Project Weaver allows for the execution of any package, regardless of what SSIS project it belongs to (a current limitation of the SSIS project deployment model). Please see the *Concepts & Definitions* page for additional details.

##What Next?
To get started we recommend that you review and install the *Prerequisites* as defined in the wiki and then continue by following the *Getting Started* page.
